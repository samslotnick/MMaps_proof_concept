This repo is a front-end proof-of-concept for a project I will be developing over the next couple weeks, called MoodMaps. MoodMaps allows a user to submit a simple form to track various moods and flag major life events on the graph, along with using a bar chart to mark activities that might affect mood (e.g. exercise, medication, etc)
